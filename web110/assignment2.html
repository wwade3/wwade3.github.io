    <p>For assignment #2 part 1 I worked on activity 3 and 5. Working on activity 3 required me to practice using web browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. After practicing with each I was asked to search the internet for tips on using my prefer browser. Each of these web browsers provides similar tools but alternates in their exact usage and naming of tools which has led to my preference of Chrome. Using the Chrome app store, I have changed my theme and included an adblocker to my Chrome browser. While these are not essential extensions, they have provided me with the method to get an extension or change my chrome browser as needed. This ease of access and comfortability with Chrome has allowed me to use it more easily as my primary browser moving forward.</p>
    <p>For my second activity on assignment #2 I worked on activity 5. This activity asked me to configure browser extensions and add-ons. This activity provided me with two websites that went into detail on plugins and browser extensions. Asked me to review my add-ons to my browser and delete any unnecessary add-ons. Finally, it suggested searching for common add-ons to add to my browser. This activity provided me with deeper insight into plug-ins and their simplicity in terms of downloading and usage as it is directly downloaded within the browser and can be implemented without closing the browser. Looking at my own add-ons I have implemented an adblocker for Chrome as a simple quality of life improvement to reduce ads as well as including a spell checker as well to ease my typing skills while using Chrome. </p>
    <p>For assignment #2 part 2 I worked on activity 2 and 6. While working on activity 2 I had to compare results of various web browsers as well as look up the search engine market share on my preferred web browser which was Chrome. I found Chrome to have the simplest interface with suggestions for other results being assigned as tabs within your search results while the other three had them off to the side. Chrome provides the best results in my opinion as it directly gave me suggestions for the other web browsers while the other three showed me rankings of web browsers instead. I plan on using Chrome moving forward as it provided me the information closest to what I was looking for. </p>
    <p>For my second activity on assignment #2 I worked on activity 6. Using the example Internet_Fundamentals/Search_engines citation provided me the bibliographical information for the article as well as multiple citation formats that can be used including AOA, MLA, MHRA, Chicago, CBE/C SE, Bluebook, and Bib Tex styles and entries. This conversion into multiple citations allows me to present citated information within my webpages moving forward and provides the correct information in these citations. Each citation style presents the information in a slightly different way; however, they all include the initial citation search, a link to the citated source and the date accessed. Some provide the author of the article while others include the retrieval date of the information. This can be used in my creation of webpages as well as other Wikiversity sourced projects. </p>
