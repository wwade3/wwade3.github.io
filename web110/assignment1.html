    <p>For this assignment I worked on the Complete the following Tutorials. This activity was focused on what the internet can provide. From providing access to the world wide web, which can allow access to websites on any topic, to communication, entertainment, and much more. The internet is structured around worldwide interconnected computer networks, which provides every computer an IP location that functions as that computer's identifier. In order to access the internet one of six methods is needed including Dial-up connection, ISDN, DSL, Cable TV connection, Satellite internet connection, and Wireless internet connection. Each of these connections have their own positives and negatives which I have never considered the difference between internet connections and how much of an impact it can have on upload and download speeds from the internet. These connections are provided through ISPs, or internet service providers, including Access providers, Mailbox providers, Hosting ISPs, Virtual ISPs, and Free ISPs. In order to receive the internet connection through any form an ISP  will be needed in order to provide that connection. This process from ISP to Connection to client is a process I havenâ€™t thought about before, I have always just assumed it was solely the connection into your home or business directly. This information provides thorough background information on the internet and its capabilities and requirements for use.
